                    <h2>John Rose</h2>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <h4>District: 6th congressional district</h4>
                    <h4>Political Affiliation: Republican</h4>
                    <p>Rose is the representative for Tennessee’s 6th congressional district (view map) and is a Republican.
                        He has served since Jan 3, 2019. Rose is next up for reelection in 2022 and serves until Jan 3, 2023.</p> 

                        

                    <h4></h4>
                            <p>Rose is among the Republican legislators whose attempt to disenfranchise
                            Democratic states in the 2020 presidential election was a part of the months-long 
                            attempted coup that included the January 6, 2021 insurrection at the Capitol. 
                            Shortly after the 2020 election, Rose joined a case before the Supreme Court calling
                            for all the votes for president in Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin — states
                            that were narrowly won by Democrats — to be discounted based on lies, conspiracy theories,
                            and a preposterous legal argument which the Supreme Court rejected. Following
                            the rejection of several related cases before the Supreme Court, another legislator who 
                            joined the case called for violence. On January 6, 2021 in the hours after the attack on 
                            the Capitol, Rose voted for the exclusion of all of the votes in Arizona and/or Pennsylvania — states
                            narrowly won by Democrats — from the Electoral College count that determined the next President 
                            of the United States. These legislators have generally changed their story after their vote,
                            claiming it was merely a protest and not intended to change the outcome of the election as 
                            they clearly sought prior to the vote.</p>
